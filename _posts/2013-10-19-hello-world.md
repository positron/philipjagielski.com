I finally got around to buying a domain and setting up a blog. Now I have my own space on the interwebs! 

I'm currently using [Jekyll][jekyll] to take my posts, written in [markdown][md], and auto-generate a static website. Then I upload the files to Amazon [S3][s3] and let it do what it does best: serve static content for pennies a gigabyte. I love this setup so far because it affords me complete control over my domain, yet it is dirt cheap.

This website is version controlled on [github][repo], so feel free to send me pull requests for spelling and grammer corrections, or anything else! The web sure has come a long way since I wrote my first blog in 2005. Back then, the coolest feature my blog had was auto-updating comments inspired by this new-fangled tech [gmail was using][ajax]!.
